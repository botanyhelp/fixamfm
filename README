fixamfm is a google app engine python web application 

It allows client to submit a request to any radio station.  Radio stations can monitor these requests in this same app. 

The profanity filter benefited from the list of bad words at CMU:

www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/bad-words.txt

That list is good except that okay words like 'fire' are in there.  A request like this: '''The Doors, Light My Fire''' will go in like this '''The Doors, Light My ____'''.  This list was appended to with other unwanted items like @, http, https, ftp, and a few others.  

The list of stations was pulled from wikipedia.  All of that data is shared under this license:
